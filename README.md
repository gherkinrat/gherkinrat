<h2>1. Slide Tackling</h2>
<p>Slide tackling is when you slide on the floor with one leg extending to push the ball away from a player. This is a foul because this can injure a player from missing the ball to dislocating the ankle. If a slide tackle is commited, the player that did the slide tackling must be sent to the sin bin.</p>
