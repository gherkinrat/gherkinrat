<h2>1. Slide Tackling</h2>
<p>Slide tackling is when you slide on the floor with one leg extending to push the ball away from a player. This is a foul because this can injure a player from missing the ball to dislocating the ankle. If a slide tackle is commited, the player that did the slide tackling must be sent to the sin bin.</p>

<h2>2. Pushing</h2>
<p>Pushing is when you physically use your force to drag someone away from you. This is a foul because the victim can lose their balance and fall. Although pushing with shoulders is allowed, pushing with hands is not because it can create a larger force where with shoulders doesnt impact the victim as much.</p>

<h2>3. Kicing a player</h2>
<p>Kicing a player may not always be intentional, but it is still a foul. Even if its accidental and you're trying to get the ball you cannot physically kick a player. Some alternatives to getting the ball can be marking the players on the opposing team. You can get the ball any way except by physically injuring or hurting a player.</p>
